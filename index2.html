    <p>Neighborhood girl rescues cat from tree</p>
    <p>
      Jill Jackson, a resident of Oak Lane, climbed up a tree in her front yard
      to save her neighbor's cat, Whiskers, who had gotten stuck in its highest
      branches.

      Whiskers has a reputation in the neighborhood for getting into trouble,
      often appearing inside of homes to steal snacks or shiny objects.
      Nonetheless, he is beloved by neighbors, including the young Miss Jackson.

      When asked to comment on her daring rescue, Jill simply replied, "Well, he
      wasn't going to get down himself!"
